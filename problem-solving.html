      <h6>Explain when you were blocked on a simple problem</h6>
      <p class="quote">What was the problem?</p>
      <p>It was a task that was a function that took a string and returned that string with the word buzz removed. But the part that got me stuck was doing this regardless of the capitalization of the word. I knew about the .toLowerCase() function but was overcomplicating where to use it.</p>
      <img src="./assets/problem-to-solve-sol-2.png" class="code-img">
      <p>I initially thought I wanted to loop through the array before my filter method and turn everything lower case but that wouldn’t work unless I can return the string with the correct characters capitalized again. I was stuck on this idea of keeping track of what letters were capitals before an then correcting them again after removing the buzz. I knew this was overcomplicated already so didn’t go ahead and try it.</p>
      <p class="quote">What problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>
      <p>I went to the discord to help but accidentally used the rubber ducky method. In the handbook it says to explain what you were doing and what you expected. While I was tying out what my process was and describing the filter method I realised while typing “It passes in a word and then compares that to the string we want to remove” in that moment I realised that was where we can use the .toLowerCase() method as it wont change the initial string. </p>

      <p class="quote">How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
      <p>It wasn't frustrating but it was hard to shake my initial solution out. I felt tunnel visioned on an idea that wouldn’t really work, but because I wanted to change the string before passing it into the filter method I was looking only for solutions outside that area not on the line of code where the answer lay.</p>
      <p class="quote">What did you learn?</p>
      <p>Use the rubber ducky method and maybe to add a reverse pseudo code aswell. Typing comments explaining what each line does and maybe I can find where to inject the next piece of the puzzle.</p>
      <h6>Explain where you elegantly solved a problem.</h6>
      <p class="quote">What was the problem?</p>
      <p>The problem was to make a function that created an object from the other parameters passed into the function. The function would do everything that we just did in the challenge in one step.</p>
      <img src="./assets/problem-to-solve-sol-3.png" class="code-img">
      <p class="quote">What problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>
      <p>Pseudo code writing out the steps one at a time which helped me see how straight forward this process can be. Remembering a few syntax rules for objects the code was simple but also very functional. </p>
      <p class="quote">How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
      <p>Calm having used the pseudo code it was straight forward process but also having the solution make sense after I wrote the pseudo code made me understand how useful of a tool it is, diving head first into the coding can quickly over complicate just as the first challenge was for me </p>
      <p class="quote">What did you learn?</p>
      <p>The importance of pseudo code as mentioned above its strong tool that can help simplify tasks and layout the goals ahead. I also had a moment I wouldn’t describe as learning but having knowledge I forgot I had come to me when I needed it was quite a cool feeling hopefully through practise that can be something that happens more often. The more I pracitse now the easier little things will come back to me in the future.</p>
      <h6>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h6>
      <p class="quote">Pseudocode</p>
      <p>Getting better I use this most of the time although unless it was hard to understand more of the TDD tasks were kinda pseudo code so that helped. I need to work on writing pseudo code in a more english way I often write somewhat code in comments.</p>
      <p class="quote">Trying something</p>
      <p>I often run through things in my head. I need to just start trying something I think I decide if it’s a good idea or not prior to writing it so that needs some work as doing it may show my a new idea or a simpler way</p>
      <p class="quote">Rubber ducky method</p>
      <p>Going to start using this one more often. I hadn’t before but after it immediate success this and pseudo code will be my go to.</p>
      <p class="quote">Reading error messages</p>
      <p>Unless it says undefined I often don’t know what it saying I usually look for the error line and go from there. Going to need some work but being able to see what line is often help enough at the moment,</p>
      <p class="quote">Console.logging</p>
      <p>I use this all the time when Im working in arrays I at almost everystep use this to make sure I am thinking what I am passing through is what I think it is. It helps lift the veil from what the computer sees vs what we do.</p>
      <p class="quote">Googling</p>
      <p>So far it is often in search of how to use a method but being able to understand stack overflow and Docs is helping understand. I so far have avoided searching the question because I feel like google can just deliver the answer which would stop me from understanding</p>
      <p class="quote">Asking your peers or  coaches for help</p>
      <p>This is always super effective, if its just another pair of eyes to spot a syntax error or getting send links to Docs a path to the soultion is provided with a high success rate</p>
      <p class="quote">Improving your process with reflection</p>
      <p>Reflecting has been a good thing to be doing but actively doing what you outlined as setbacks while having issues is a real skill I will continue to work on. Being able to acitvly think about a previous mistake while in the midst of the current one will need some practise.</p>
