      <h6>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h6>
      <p>I enjoy planning and writing down goals having a learning plan helps me see what the focus of the day should be in the short term therefore helping the long term. I’m not a fan of sharing the core blogs in the discord. It’s quite personal sometimes and sharing that with people I do not know is very humbling and a little uncomfortable/embarrasing (These aren’t quite the right words but its very similar feeling). Lastly meditating is quite fun and very useful as something repetitive to do each day before studying its almost conditioning to always be productive once it is over. </p>
      <h6>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h6>
      <p>Empathy when learning and especially when learning at a cohort is about being able to admit when something is difficult or that you don’t understand, looking into the growth mindset in sprint 3 was all about learning taking place in that area of challenge and difficulty having that empathy means me and my pairs will be more willing to take that on and not be afraid of failure. As mentioned above with the growth mindset and when learning takes place having self-awareness of what is challenging for yourself and how you deal with the feelings and difficulty surrounding that means that you can safely and appropriately push yourself </p>
      <h6>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h6>
      <p>How difficult doing things I don’t want to do can be, I’ve had a lot to take away form core so far but the main take away isn’t the content as much as how when there is something I don’t want to do it can take longer that wanted to get around ot completing. This ties back to self awareness in that it is important for me to do the things I don’t want to as it will help me improve.</p>
      <h6>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h6>
      <p>Chanelling thoughts and emotions into written form. Being able to communictate what you think or feel in your own head can be difficult to word and knowing if the reader is picking up what you are meaning to put down.</p>
      <h6>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h6>
      <p>In a workplace it can be difficult to use just productivity and outcomes to measure a potential for either a job opportunity or a promotion. So learning how to effectively communicate and work as a team member and a competent team leader alongside having a strong skill set needed in the technical side of programming can give the needed ability to land roles and stand out. Being just good with core or just good with tech wouldn’t grant as good results as being well versed in both.</p>
      <h6>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h6>
      <p>As stated above “Being just good with core or just good with tech wouldn’t grant as good results as being well versed in both.” As much as I don’t enjoy core as much as I do tech I understand the necessity for both and what that means going forward inmy career, also in my learning plan I mention the want to be a freelancer having strong communication skills will help me in achieving that goal so there is a motivating factor for me there.</p>
