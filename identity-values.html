      <h6>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h6>
      <p>I used to work retail in a formal menswear store in St Lukes and had a customer, which I enjoyed serving that day, they needed one more item for a wedding happening the following day which a store of ours in another location had it was too late in the day for them to go themselves to get the item and if we were to post it in the mail it would take to long and those when following the rules are the only too options. For their sake and I luckily had a key to the other store and was working first thing in the morning at the St Lukes store. I pitched an idea that if they were available to come back first thing in the morning I could get the item for them which would fix their issue. The idea was that I would go to the other store earlier than opening and get the item use the computer to send it legally but breaking the rules I would not send it in the courier but just bring it to St Lukes, It all worked out and everyone wins in the situation but I did have to bend the rules. They had left in a bit late and caused themselves a problem but I justified my actions by knowing there is a fix to remove the stress and it would benefit the company and the customer doing so. Looking back I wouldn’t change my decision I know I did the right thing for them and knowing the company I worked for if I was caught I believe they would understand and maybe appreciate what I did. </p>
      <h6>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h6>
      <p>I wouldn’t describe my self as having culture but my father is definitely a huge role model for me. He works as a artist painting native nz trees he spent a long time working at this skills and figuring out how to monetize it working with galleries and such at a younger age and now he can support a family of five. He works harder than I thought possible and it’s always been a thing for both my parents to say “always try your best” and he leads by example of what ‘best’ means. No matter the outcome they are happy if I can say I tried my best.  It has also shown me times I didn’t get what I wanted  or didn’t achieve something and when I think, did I try my best? The answer is often, no.</p>
      <h6>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h6>
      <p>After doing one of the personality tests I found I have an eagle personality type which is a goal oriented, confident and hardworking individual it is also a good leadership personality. I’m thinking that this style will be beneficial in the sense if im confident it will help take on more difficult challenges and pushing into difficult territory which means I can get the most out of what is actually quite a short period of time at Dev. Being in a leadership position, if the opportunity is there, might look more like a mentor position having worked as a webflow developer I might be a useful resource for my peers and being able to help others will also help myself understand concepts and inturn is a win win for everyone. In another test humor was my number one trait so aiming to bring some morale and enthusiasm to team events and being able to see the funny side of things when we are having a tough time. </p>
      <h6>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h6>
      <p>A weakness of mine will definitely be born from one of my strengths, confidence, in that people I know often say I come of as cocky or arrogant. It's something I will need to be aware of and realise that humility and empathy are really important traits in a educational environment. My age may play into things aswell with people thinking I’m a bit naive, I’m in a very early stage of my career and that means others will have skills from other areas of expertise that I can learn from but also not letting people brush off my own experience due to being younger. </p>
      <h6>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h6>
      <p>Often when in a team and there is a deadline or a grade and there is a person slacking or not contributing to their part of the task I find myself jumping in and taking over and even if this results in a finished product or a better grade it isn't the right course of action. When this happens in the future I’m going to ask the person what I can do to assist them or try and suit their needs over mine at the end of the day we are all here to learn and I can’t be taking that away from anyone. </p>
