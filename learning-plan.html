      <h6>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h6>
      <p>I would like to be able to return to the company I was working for previously as a Webflow dev, Daylight, but return as a Developer. I haven’t explored much about backend and it will be one of the things I want to do during this course but I really enjoy frontend and would enjoy working in that field. I would also in the long term like to expand into freelancing as that would provide a freedom in terms of work locations which would align with other goals of mine outside of a career. </p>
      <h6>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h6>
      <p>Optimisim, I don’t believe that there is anything that we can’t learn or achieve it’s just about practise. This will help take on the harder challenges which in turn often teach us the most. I still need to work on reaching out for help my strength is also a weakness as I will want to solve problems without help but having you guys as a resource is what I’m here for so I need to use it. </p>
      <h6>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h6>
      <p>My communication. I am not very good at explaining things so learning how to teach something and explain that in a useful way while also being able to explain when I myself am having issues and what those issues are from a technical problem point of view and also just from a personal problem point of view. I imagine a lot of the pair programming work and the team projects will help in that area but also will help learning how to collaborate. The communication aspect is important as if I was really serious about doing freelance work learning to talk to clients will be a huge challenge to work on. I also have worked in a web development team so I can bring in workflows and tricks to make the process of designing and developing easier. </p>
      <h6>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h6>
      <p>Currently with the workload treating it as a 9-5 job is working well I act as if there is someone watching me from behind so no long phone breaks or video watching during those hours. I also have alot of spare time around those 9-5 hours so if I need to play catchup I can work extra in the evening. If things are starting to build up I will, first step, likely asses if im putting enough time in, as simple as working in some extra hours,  If I am working alot already maybe letting a facilitator know and getting advice from them. If it was a team project and the work was getting to me I would reach out to the team and maybe there is a solution with delegating the work accordingly or just getting some extra help. </p>
      <h6>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h6>
      <p>I think it’s really important to learn to be able to get yourself unstuck and through the difficult challenges but If something is taking too long to solve and it halting progress for more than 30 mins of completly no progress it might be time to reach out to the discord and get a hand, You guys, Facilitators and students,  have been ontop of fixing problems and replying fast so that is super appreciated. </p>
      <h6>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h6>
      <p>Its in the name for me Facilitator, used in a sentence "a true educator acts as a facilitator of learning". I expect them to provide the path of least resistance so I can learn, they will help us to think of solutions to a problem without providing it and will be a constructive voice to keep us pushing. Lots of facilitators have been through this course if there was anything that they would’ve done differently or that anything that will help I would appreciate the criticisms and recommendations.</p>
      <h6>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h6>
      <p>I have no block out times that are consistent in my week but when random things popup I’ll adjust my schedule to make sure the work is completed and done in a beneficial way, not rushing ideally. </p>
