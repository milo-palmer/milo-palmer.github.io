      <p class="blog-text-p1">Until recently, the conventional thinking was that our brains were hard-wired at birth and therefore unchangeable. In actuality, our brains are like malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped by our daily experiences. Science has also revealed that our beliefs about ourselves, what we think and feel about our abilities and our beliefs about 'success' and 'failure' hugely influence our outcomes.</p>

      <h6>Understanding Neuroplasticity</h6>
      <p>The brain used to be seen as a static and unchangeable organism but these days it is seen as plastic and importantly changing constantly. Imagination and action go hand in hand and engage the same neuron pathways. Two groups of piano players entered a study one group could play the piano for practise and the other sat infront of a piano but practised mentally both groups saw similar short term results but the physically practising group started to surpase the mental after almsot a week although the mentally practising group could catch up very quickly.</p>
      <p>Neuroplasticy is all about how the brain changes and how neurons can grow new pathways when learning now things but they can also with practise grow larger and stronger allowing more cells to pass through. Repetition is therefore an extremely important toll for learning and understanding concepts.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes."<br> - Judy Willis</p>
      <p>Teaching students this idea that intelligence is malleable and that they can increase their IQ and ability with practise and affirming this with science has great impact. The students taught this concept have a leap in morale and grades it removes the negagive feedback of “your stupid you can’t learn this” to a feeing of challenge and persisting to win.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Even in middle or old age, it's still adapting very actively to its environment."<br> - Kurt Fischer</p>
      <h6>Growth Mindset</h6>
      <p>The Growth mindset is all about understanding that mistakes and difficult challenges are the place you learn the most. It’s about not backing down from a challenge and putting in effort to solve problems and in that state the learning happens.</p>
      <p>There was an interesting study done where 400 5th grade students did an easy IQ test, one they all are expected to do well in, but the way they were praised changed between two options. One group was told you are so intelligent and the other was told how this took a lot of hard work to achieve. The groups being praised by intelligence vs effort brought in strange results. When they were offered a choice between an easy test again or a harder test that will be challenging but will teach them alot, of the ‘smart’ group 67% chose to take the easy test compared to the hard working group who 92% chose to take the hard test.</p>

      <p>The physiology behind this was the ‘smart’ kids had to maintain the image they are smart so avoid the risk of looking dumb. Similar studies have been done using a range of easy to difficult puzzles and again the kids got praised in tow differing ways. The hard working group started to take on the harder puzzles and had a stubborn attitude to solving them whereas the smart group didn’t take on challenges and when did would give up fast and get irritated.</p>
